10.45 C4 Original PreWorkout Powder, 30 Servings. The Coupon Thang From thecouponthang.com
Throwing up after taking some old c4 pre workout and tryna be funny. You should warm up and cool down before and after a workout to stretch muscles and ease your heart rate into and out of target zones to avoid injury. Never gulp water during exercise. For some reason when i take pre workouts like (horse power, or fuzion) i have a tendancy to throwup or feel as if i need to, its never right away tho.
